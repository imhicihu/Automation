# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the current timestamp with date included
  - trigger: ":time"
    replace: "{{time}}"
    vars:
      - name: time
        type: date
        params:
         format: "el %d/%m/%Y a las %H:%M:%S"

  # Print the current timestamp with date included
  - trigger: ":up"
    replace: "{{time}}"
    vars:
      - name: time
        type: date
        params:
         format: "Updated on %d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S"

  # Overcome IMHICIHU
  - trigger: ":ic"
    label: "IMHICIHU"
    replace: >-
      IMHICIHU-CONICET
      
  # Overcome IMHICIHU's email
  - trigger: ":im"
    label: "IMHICIHU@gmail.com"
    replace: >-
      imhicihu@gmail.com
